# BIT Services
*Diploma of Software Development Final Project*

## Who are BIT Services?

BIT Field Support Services is a division of Business Information Technology Pty (BIT) that provides IT support and services to clients across Australia through the use of field contractors. BIT Services has been restricted by their current manual system and management has been looking for a fully automated system, hence the initiation of this project. 

## How was this project developed?

This project was developed over the course of a semester, starting from an initial project proposal. This proposal was analysed and reviewed to match the client's needs and requirements. After analysing the original proposal, a series of possible solutions were drafted up to be selected from, including pre-built software and a custom build solution. From the selection of a proposal, the current system implemented was to be analysed and reviewed for potential improvements and required sections. Following analysis comes the actual design of the application.

The application was to consist of two sections:
1. A desktop admin application in which an admin could log in and manage request for jobs to contractors, along with approving completed jobs for payment. This application was to be written in C# using the .NET Framework via WPF.
2. A cloud application for contractors in which they could view their active jobs, mark jobs as complete, and accepted any new job requests. This application was to be written in C# using ASP.NET via Web Forms.

Both of these applications would communication to each other via a single database created via SQL Server.
